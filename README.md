# Project:
# Iris Flowers Predictor
# Version: 1.0.0

# Description:
This is a large C++ program that will predict what kind of Iris Flower you have. 
It does this by taking the length and width of the Sepal and Petal that you have and the Iris-Dataset csv file for data to power its predictions.
This program exercises Machine Learning by taking in values for a new Iris flower.
It uses data from the famous iris dataset, and then processes the new input.
Afterwards, it will show how confidient it is in its prediction, and then add the new flower in as the
type it is most sure that it is. 

# NOTE:
The readability on this is pretty rough, this is intentional, 
as I was more focused on getting a working prototype than making 
it run as best it can.

I used the knowledge of C++ that I best was familar with to create this, 
but I plan on refactoring this code later on.
Project is currently over 500 lines long.
